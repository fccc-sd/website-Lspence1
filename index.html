<h2> A Little Bit About My Life</h2>

<p>My Full name is Logan Chase Spence I am in 11th grade. Before I decided to come to
Four County I went to many schools like Evergreen, Delta, and Liberty Center.
I am already so glad I came to Four County. I am making new friends and learning new things.
I am at home I mostly play video games. My favorite games is any Far Cry game. I play these games on me xbox at home. But I would play different multiplayer games with my friends and siblings. I have 4 siblings three brothers and one sister.
I like to help my parents as much as I can. And I like to play basketball outside. Because there is a court behind my house.
</p>

<h3> My Different Animals</h3>

<p>One dog named Trixie. She is about 4 years old. My little sister cam up with the name.
    And it ended up being a good name for her. Because all she does is tricks.
    we ended up getting her because my siblings wanted a dog.
    So our parents suprized us for christmas. We have had her for about 2 years now.
    And one kitten that we got recently. He is only about nine weeks old.
    We still have not made a name for him yet. Some people from my town found him in front of my house.
    So we started to take care of him. 
</p>

<h3> In The Future</h3>

<p> What I plan to do in the future is hopefully get a job I will in joy doing for the rest of my life.
    Me and my friend are going to live together and split the rent evenly. If I am not outside I am playing video games.
    I am trying to save as much money I get to have it for the future.
    I already have a car ready for me when I get my license. The car just needs a little work and it will be good enough to drive were I need to go.
    I want to have enough money to help my parents out when they need it. I am planning on graduating highschool.
    The games I play the most are Assassin's Creed and Far Cry so hopefully in the future they will make new games.
